# the_valley
In this solo project, I was responsible for designing and developing a game experience with the theme of interconnected gameplay systems.

The Valley is a single-player survival/exploration game in which the player has crash-landed their plane in a valley completely surrounded on all sides with steep mountains which are impossible to escape from. The only thing which survived from the crash was the player character themself and their radio which they can use to call for help. However, the radio was damaged in the crash and must be repaired before it can be used. The goal of the game is to survive long enough to gather all the resources necessary to repair the radio and be rescued.

The valley is full of forests and lakes waiting to be explored. There are various types of plants that can be harvested and eaten raw, or cooked over a fire in order to restore more hunger. Resources such as rocks and wooden planks are also abundant and can be used to craft tools for yourself such as an axe and a pickaxe, which are then used for gathering resources that cannot be acquired by hand. As soon as all the resources required to repair the radio are acquired, the player character will be able to call for help and will be rescued, thus completing the game.
